DataBro

A user behaviour analytics dashboard. Databro allows site owners to sign up and 
specify what behaviour they want tracked on their site. Then, they include a JS 
script on their site to enable tracking. User behaviour is then sent to Databro.
The dashboard displays overviews of user behaviour, such as session timings and 
website page flow.
